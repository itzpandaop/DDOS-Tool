# DDoS Tool (Educational Purposes Only)

This project contains a tool capable of conducting Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The tool uses both `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP-based attacks and `socket` for TCP-based attacks.

⚠️ **Warning:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of DDoS or DoS attacks against systems without explicit permission is illegal and punishable by law. Use responsibly and only in controlled, legal environments (e.g., testing your own infrastructure).

## Features

- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests (aiohttp)**: Allows for high concurrency to target web servers.
- **TCP Socket Flooding**: Sends multiple TCP requests to the target IP/domain.
- **Logging**: Provides real-time logs of attack status.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itzpandaop/DDOS-Tool.git
